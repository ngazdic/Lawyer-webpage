                                European Union Law and the access to Abortion “Translated Title from Greek”
                            </h2>
                            <p class="news-section-description">Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the extent 
                                of a 14 years prison sentence except under
                                certain narrowed exceptions. Nevertheless, 
                                European Union Law considers abortion as a 
                                ‘Service’ and most of the EU Member States have
                                sufficiently more relaxed access to abortion 
                                services than Cyprus currently does. Taken as
                                granted that EU Law explicitly overrides Cyprus
                                national law, even on the criminalisation of
                                abortion, it follows that any Cypriot woman can
                                vindicate her access to abortion, through the EU 
                                principle of freedom of services. This is in
                                relation not only in establishing access to
                                abortion, but also in claiming refund for up 
                                to the total costs that occurred to the Cyprus
                                woman by being forced to travel to another Member 
                                State in fulfilling such task.</p>

                                2015. Hereto, the Supreme Court nullified the
                                trial Court’s findings on the death inquisition
                                of Akis Kleanthous, former Minister of Education
                                and Culture. The case is considered important,
                                since it is the first Cypriot caselaw where it 
                                was stated as a judicial finding that the patient
                                had not been informed as to why his chosen medical
                                treatment was better and preferred over an 
                                available alternative treatment.</p>
